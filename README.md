## Getting Started

AWS Code Habits was developed to be used as a [git submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules).

On a terminal, on your project's root directory, execute one of the following commands:

```bash
git submodule add --name habits -b main https://github.com/awslabs/aws-code-habits.git habits
```

This will clone AWS Code Habits on a folder named `habits` and track against the `main` branch.
Now, you will need to create, or add to your existing, `Makefile`.

```bash
export WORKSPACE=$(shell pwd)
export HABITS = $(WORKSPACE)/habits

include $(WORKSPACE)/tools.env # pin the version of your tools

include $(HABITS)/lib/make/*/*.mk
include $(HABITS)/lib/make/*.mk
```

Remember, next time you need to clone your repository, you will need to include `--recurse-submodules` parameters.
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules ...
```
> If you already cloned the project and forgot `--recurse-submodules`, you can combine the `git submodule init` and `git submodule update` steps by running `git submodule update --init`. To also initialize, fetch and checkout any nested submodules, you can use the foolproof `git submodule update --init --recursive`. - [Git Tools Submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules)

Check the [scripts](scripts/) directory, if you want to automate the initialization and installation of AWS Code Habits.`


## Prerequisites
  A list of things you need, or how to install them.
> At this stage, we are only supporting Linux (Ubuntu) environments (which can be obtained via WSL (Windows) or DevContainers (Mac/Linux/Windows))

- [Python 3](https://www.python.org) - Whether you're new to programming or an experienced developer, it's easy to learn and use Python.
- [Pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) - pip is the package installer for Python.



## Usage

```bash
make [tab][tab]
```

```bash
make help
```
For more information about each [Make targets available](Makefile.md).

## How-Tos
Below you can learn

### How to initialize pre-commit config
```bash
make pre-commit/init
```

To run all `pre-commit` rules in all files, simply run:

```bash
make pre-commit/run
```

### How to maintain documentation
1. First initialize all documentation files:
```bash
make doc/init
```

This will create a folder named `doc/` in the root directory of your project and create a file named `habits.yaml` inside of it.

2. Modify the contents of `doc/habits.yaml` accordingly and execute:

```
make doc/build
```

3. `README.md` will be rendered.

### How to expand Habits commands
You can use [Habits][habits] to meet your needs, in your `Makefile` you can add the following to ensure code and documentation hygiene:
```bash
.PHONY: hygiene
hygiene: doc/build pre-commit/run
```

Another example, if you want to perform several tasks with `AWS CloudFormation`:
```bash
.PHONY: hygiene
hygiene: aws/cloudformation/hygiene

.PHONY: plan
plan: aws/cloudformation/create-change-set

.PHONY: discard
discard: aws/cloudformation/delete-change-set

.PHONY: apply
apply: aws/cloudformation/execute-change-set
```


## Testing
To perform habits checks:
```bash
make habits/check
```
