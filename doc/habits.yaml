    caption: Installing AWS Code Habits

title: AWS Code Habits

description: A library with Make targets, Ansible playbooks, Jinja templates (and more) designed to boost common software development tasks and enhance governance.

getting_started: |-
  AWS Code Habits was developed to be used as a [git submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules).

  On a terminal, on your project's root directory, execute one of the following commands:

  ```bash
  git submodule add --name habits -b main https://github.com/awslabs/aws-code-habits.git habits
  ```

  This will clone AWS Code Habits on a folder named `habits` and track against the `main` branch.
  Now, you will need to create, or add to your existing, `Makefile`.

  ```bash
  export WORKSPACE=$(shell pwd)
  export HABITS = $(WORKSPACE)/habits

  include $(WORKSPACE)/tools.env # pin the version of your tools

  include $(HABITS)/lib/make/*/*.mk
  include $(HABITS)/lib/make/*.mk
  ```

  Remember, next time you need to clone your repository, you will need to include `--recurse-submodules` parameters.
  ```bash
  git clone --recurse-submodules ...
  ```
  > If you already cloned the project and forgot `--recurse-submodules`, you can combine the `git submodule init` and `git submodule update` steps by running `git submodule update --init`. To also initialize, fetch and checkout any nested submodules, you can use the foolproof `git submodule update --init --recursive`. - [Git Tools Submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules)

  Check the [scripts](scripts/) directory, if you want to automate the initialization and installation of AWS Code Habits.`

  - title: How to initialize pre-commit config
    content: |-
      ```bash
      make pre-commit/init
      ```

      To run all `pre-commit` rules in all files, simply run:

      ```bash
      make pre-commit/run
      ```

  - title: How to maintain documentation
    content: |-
      1. First initialize all documentation files:
      ```bash
      make doc/init
      ```

      This will create a folder named `doc/` in the root directory of your project and create a file named `habits.yaml` inside of it.

      2. Modify the contents of `doc/habits.yaml` accordingly and execute:

      ```
      make doc/build
      ```

      3. `README.md` will be rendered.

  - title: How to expand Habits commands
    content: |-
      You can use [Habits][habits] to meet your needs, in your `Makefile` you can add the following to ensure code and documentation hygiene:
      ```bash
      .PHONY: hygiene
      hygiene: doc/build pre-commit/run
      ```

      Another example, if you want to perform several tasks with `AWS CloudFormation`:
      ```bash
      .PHONY: hygiene
      hygiene: aws/cloudformation/hygiene

      .PHONY: plan
      plan: aws/cloudformation/create-change-set

      .PHONY: discard
      discard: aws/cloudformation/delete-change-set

      .PHONY: apply
      apply: aws/cloudformation/execute-change-set
      ```

testing: |-
  To perform habits checks:
  ```bash
  make habits/check
  ```
